This tool was created to allow for users of Poll Everywhere (polleverywhere.com) to create enhanced analytics beyond the capabilities of the service. For example, if we are polling for political preferences for instance, Poll Everywhere may reveal how many voters in aggregate versus a certina. This program intends to go deeper by finding out for instance, how many females or males, lean a certain way.
